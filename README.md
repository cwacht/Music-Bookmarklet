# Music-Bookmarklet
A standalone bookmarklet that plays audio from a page in a full page player.

[Visit the gh-page](https://cwacht.github.io/Music-Bookmarklet/) to drag the bookmarklet into your browser.


##Basic use:
* Bookmark it
* Visit a page that links to audio files
* Click the bookmarklet

##Features:
* Play/pause
* Prev/Next
* Random
* Click any song in the playlist to play it
* Click a point along the progressbar to skip ahead/back

* On Android devices:
  * Player controls are available via a Media Notification.
  * So the player can run in the background and be controled without returning to the browser tab.
  * As a result, the player can also be controlled via connected devices with media controls or notification sync (Headphones, smartwatches, etc...)


* If no audio files are detected when the bookmarklet is clicked:
  * A prompt will appear with an input.
  * Enter the type of audio you would like to find, and click 'ok'.
  * A custom Google search will return pages containing audio links and the search term.
  * Visit one of the pages from the Google search.
  * Click the bookmarklet


##If it doesn't work:
* Refresh the page (without using the bookmarklet) and test the links to audio files.
* Clicking one of these links should play it in the browser's default audio player.
* If it does something else (doesnt play, loads another webpage, initiates a download, etc...), then that page will not work.

* If the links do play in the browser, but the boomarklet still doesnt work, it is probably my fault.


##Support:
I have tested in Chrome on Mac, Android, and Chromebook. That is all.
