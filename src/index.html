<a href='javascript:/*inject:bookmarklet*//*endinject*/'>Play Audio</a>

<h2>Basic use:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Bookmark it</li>
  <li>Visit a page that links to audio files</li>
  <li>Click the bookmarklet</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Play/pause</li>
  <li>Prev/Next</li>
  <li>Random</li>
  <li>Click any song in the playlist to play it</li>
  <li>Click a point along the progressbar to skip ahead/back</li>


  <li>
    On Android devices:
    <ul>
      <li>Player controls are available via a Media Notification.</li>
      <li>So the player can run in the background and be controled without returning to the browser tab.</li>
      <li>As a result, the player can also be controlled via connected devices with media controls or notification sync (Headphones, smartwatches, etc...)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    If no audio files are detected when the bookmarklet is clicked:
    <ul>
      <li>A prompt will appear with an input.</li>
      <li>Enter the type of audio you would like to find, and click 'ok'.</li>
      <li>A custom Google search will return pages containing audio links and the search term.</li>
      <li>Visit one of the pages from the Google search.</li>
      <li>Click the bookmarklet</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>If it doesn't work:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Refresh the page (without using the bookmarklet) and test the links to audio files.</li>
  <li>Clicking one of these links should play it in the browser's default audio player.</li>
  <li>If it does something else (doesnt play, loads another webpage, initiates a download, etc...), then this page will not work.</li>

  <li>If the links do play in the browser, but the boomarklet still doesnt work, it is probably my fault.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Support:</h2>
I have tested in Chrome on Mac, Android, and Chromebook. That is all.
